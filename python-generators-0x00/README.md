# Python Generators – Getting Started with Python Generators
## 📌 Project Overview

This project introduces the use of Python generators together with SQL databases.
In this first task, we focus on:

- Setting up a MySQL database called ALX_prodev.

- Creating a user_data table with specific fields.

- Seeding the table with data from a CSV file.

- Writing Python functions to connect, create, and insert data.

This forms the foundation for later tasks where we will use generators (yield) to process data efficiently.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand how to connect Python with MySQL using mysql-connector-python.

- Learn to create a database and tables programmatically.

- Practice reading and inserting CSV data into SQL tables.

- Prepare for generator functions that will stream query results one row at a time.

## 🛠️ Requirements

```
Python 3.x

MySQL server installed (with access to a root user)

mysql-connector-python library

pip install mysql-connector-python
``` 

- A CSV file user_data.csv containing sample user records.
